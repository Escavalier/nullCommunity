## 6. Runlevel

`systemd` takes over and continues to mount the hostâ€™s file systems and start services.

As soon as the kernel executes the init process, it will look at the configuration files to see the default run level.

A runlevel is a single-byte name for a particular system configuration. Runlevels for Debian and Ubuntu systems are generally as follows:

0 : System halt.
1 : Single-User mode.
2 : Graphical multi-user plus networking (DEFAULT)
3 : Same as "2", but not used.
4 : Same as "2", but not used.
5 : Same as "2", but not used.
6 : System reboot.
There are also a few pseudo-runlevels:

N : The previous runlevel cannot be determined.
S : Alias for Single-User mode.
