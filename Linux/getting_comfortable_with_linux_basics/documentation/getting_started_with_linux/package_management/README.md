## Package Management

On Linux, packages are downloaded and installed from online repositories by a package manager.

1. Advanced Packaging Tool (APT)

    The `APT` package, providing the `apt` command-line management tool.

    `apt` is a command which uses the advanced packaging tool to interact with the operating systemâ€™s package system.

            $ sudo apt upgrade -y

    3. To upgrade the system as a whole, i.e., to upgrade packages with auto-handling of dependencies which might involve removing currently installed packages if needed, run following command

            $ apt full-upgrade

    4. View all `apt` command line options

            $ apt -h
