### Advanced Packaging Tool (APT)

The `APT` package provides the `apt` command-line management tool. `apt` is a command which uses the advanced packaging tool to interact with the operating systemâ€™s package system.

1. To update the database of available packages, i.e., to allow system to find if a newer version of software is available, run following command

        $ sudo apt update

2. To upgrade the installed packages to their newer versions, run following command

        $ sudo apt upgrade -y

3. To upgrade the system as a whole, i.e., to upgrade packages with auto-handling of dependencies which might involve removing currently installed packages if needed, run following command

        $ apt full-upgrade

4. View all `apt` command line options

        $ apt -h
